`Section 1: The Problem`

Life gets in the way and people can’t always do what they’d like or need to do. Sometimes we even miss out on taking care of our most basic needs. Apps like Shortcut and StyleSeat have made attending to yourself more convenient by bringing hair and beauty services to your doorstep. 

There’s no cookie cutter approach to beauty and self-care regimens. Dashing caters to its clients’ specific needs and situations. Whatever our clients’ requirements, Dashing can fulfill them. We also offer clients instructional sessions, teaching them new skills to better care for themselves and ultimately becoming empowered in their daily lives. 

`Section 2: The Hypothesis` 

**IF:**  We make getting ready ‘head-to-toe’ for an event, easier and more convenient by bringing professional providers to you.

**FOR:** People of all ages who want or need help beautifying themselves.

**THEN:**  Clients will feel catered to and freelancing providers will feel in control of their own professional lives. 

**BECAUSE:**  People feel taken care of when being attended to in the comfort of their own home.

**WE KNOW WE’VE SUCCEEDED WHEN:** Our clients feel good about themselves and satisfied with the experience they had through our app and refer us to their friends and family.

`Section 3: The Solution (in detail)` 

Dashing is an app that brings grooming and beauty services to your doorstep. Dashing provides beauty, self-care, special services, and educational services to clients in the comfort of their own homes. Clients simply choose the service(s) they want and based on their zip code they are able to see & search through a list of qualified professionals in proximity to them, that will be at their disposal. After making a selection, the client can view the professional’s profile, which contains reviews, ranking, links to a social media page or an external portfolio, and several photos of their work. Clients can book professionals for standard appointments,  special services like weddings, on a group, corporate events, and demonstration-educational sessions to learn.

Include separate sign up form for Provider and Clients and routes to their profile management. The Provider form has five steps: basic info, choose a profession, set up services, set up availability, and about-me description. At another side, the clients have only the full name, email and password. 

The search bar will be on the homepage, that gives filtered results depending on the profession and services near to you. The location range is obtained using Google Maps Platform API and geocoding API; and the bottom of the homepage shows the user stories and testimonial.
The clients-users and the provider-users each schedules appointments using the Full Calendar API.

On the profiles, the clients only have their name, picture, a calendar, list of provider and a bonus session that add articles, and info shares it in the educational session. The provider profile has a calendar that shows appointments, picture, name, profession, about me a description, rankings, services with their distinct prices, comments session made it by their clients, links and photos that show their work, and a button bookmark.

It will be broken down into two sections: 
- The Client section: Home page to search services; Profile page to manage their account and appointment into the calendar API.
- The Provider section: Profile page to manage their account (services, availability, calendar w/ appointments, etc).

`Section 4: User Stories`

1.  Sandra is a spirited woman who loves to look good and prides herself on her appearance. She finds it difficult and tiresome to travel to hair salons to receive her weekly blowouts and monthly root touch-ups. Fortunately, she came across Dashing that shows Hair services' professionals near her and it’s easier than ever to make sure her hair is always on point.


2. Richard is the father of 2 beautiful little girls and with the very new responsibility of having to care and manage both of his daughter's hair. After struggling for a while he decided to seek out help. That’s when he discovered Dashing. Through the website, he was not only able to find someone to do his daughters hair but that same stylist began teaching him how to do it himself.

3.  Ana finds it difficult to be in loud and busy places. She has never been super in to make up so she has never learned how to properly apply it. She is going on a date for the first time in a while and wants to look extra nice but doesn’t want to risk a panic attack by going to a salon. That’s where Dashing comes in. Not only was she able to get her makeup done at home where she is comfortable but she loved her MUA so much she now has weekly sessions where she’s being taught to do it herself.

4. Becky and Liz have recently completed one of their life dreams and have adopted a child from Mali. A few weeks after bringing their newfound daughter back to their Milwaukee home they came to the realization that they had no idea how to manage their daughter's hair whose hair texture was so much different than her own. Both working full-time jobs they couldn’t find the time to learn or attempt to learn how to do her hair. Fortunately, they found Dashing and found someone to come to their home twice a month to help maintain their daughter's beautiful curls.
