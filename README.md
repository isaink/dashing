# Section 1: The Problem 

Life gets in the way and people can’t always do what they’d like or need to do. Sometimes we even miss out on taking care of our most basic needs. Apps like Shortcut and StyleSeat have made attending to yourself more convenient by bringing hair and beauty services to your doorstep. 

There’s no cookie cutter approach to beauty and self-care regimens. CombToMe caters to its clients’ specific needs and situations. Whatever our clients’ requirements, CombToMe can fulfill them. We also offer clients instructional sessions, teaching them new skills to better care for themselves and ultimately becoming empowered in their daily lives. 

Section 2: The Hypothesis 

**IF:**  We make getting ready ‘head-to-toe’ for an event, easier and more convenient by bringing professional providers to you.
**FOR:** People of all ages who want or need help beautifying themselves.
**THEN:**  Clients will feel catered to and freelancing providers will feel in control of their own professional lives. 
**BECAUSE:**  People feel taken care of when being attended to in the comfort of their own home.
**WE KNOW WE’VE SUCCEEDED WHEN:** Our clients feel good about themselves and satisfied with the experience they had through our app and refer us to their friends and family.
